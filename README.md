# Forking Workflow

The workflow implemented for the project is a **forking workflow** which is a distributed and flexible means of team collaboration.

Each team member has two Git repositories:
- Private Local Repository i.e. origin (private)
- Public Server-Side Repository i.e. upstream (public)

The objective to the Forking Workflow is to allow contributions to be integrated without the need to publish to a single central repository. Instead team members push to _their_ own private repository, and only the project maintainer can push to the official repository.

Therefore, this allows the project maintainer to accept commits from a team member without giving them write access to the official codebase.

# Getting Started

In order to contribute to the official repository, you must first **fork** it, and in turn create your own server-side repository.
