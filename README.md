# Forking Workflow

The workflow implemented for the project is a **forking workflow** which is a distributed and flexible means of team collaboration.

Each team member has two Git repositories:
- Private Local Repository i.e. origin (private)
- Public Server-Side Repository i.e. upstream (public)

The objective to the Forking Workflow is to allow contributions to be integrated without the need to publish to a single central repository. Instead team members push to _their_ own private repository, and only the project maintainer can push to the official repository.

Therefore, this allows the project maintainer to accept commits from a team member without giving them write access to the official codebase.

# Getting Started

1. In order to contribute to the official repository, you must first **fork** it on GitHub, and in turn create your own server-side repository (which is really a copy of the official repository). 
2. The forked repository only exists on GitHub and hence to be able to work on it you must clone your public forked server-side repository to your local machine. You can do this inside GitHub by clicking the green button marked _clone or download_ to clone the repository to your desktop. 
3. From there, you have an isolated personal public repository which serves as your own private development environment. You can add, commit and push as always but in order to push to the official upstream repository, a **pull request** must be invoked. Likewise, you can keep up-to-date with the upstream repository by pulling. 
4. A pull request can be issued from your public server-side repository page on Github. A pull request must first be inspected and compared before merging to the master branch of the official repository. Once a contribution is part of the official project, other team members can pull the integrated changes and sync their local repositories.
5. More information can be found in the Resources section of this README. Otherwise, post a question in the Slack #git channel.
